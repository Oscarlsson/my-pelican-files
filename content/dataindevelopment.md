Summary: 

I gave a presentation at [Sigma it consulting](http://sigmaitc.se/) on
Lindholmen, Gothenburg, about Data in development.

The audience consisted of consulting developers and managers working on companies
such as Ericsson. I wanted to share our story of early validations and
measuring user impact to validate features.

The talk is inspired by Dan McKinleys presentation but reflects what I
work with and what I spend my time thinking about.
