Summary: 

As a master student mayoring in Machine Learning I've tried to research what
companies and institutions in Gothenburg that does Machine Learning or Big data-related stuff. I was
looking for future work place and trying to understand how the Machine Learning community in GBG worked.

I thought I would share what I've found.
This list is probably not complete and I would love to add information about your company or 
research group as well as update or change the information given below.

The Machine Learning community in Gothenburg is not big which partly motivates this summary. 
Recently, Karina Bunyik [link], started a meet-up group for Machine Learning Gothenburg [link].
Interesting seminars is published at LAB-groups calendar [link]
