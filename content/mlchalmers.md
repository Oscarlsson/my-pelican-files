Summary: 
I gave a 45 min presentation at the Machine Learning class at Chalmers
titled "Big Data and Machine Learning @ Spotify". 

Just recently taking the course as a student I tried to connect the theoretical parts presented in
the course with what the industry does and needs. As data processing and
cleaning of data is a big part in industry but rightfully skipped in a ML
class I mentioned that.
