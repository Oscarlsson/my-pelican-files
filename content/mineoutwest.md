Summary: 

As part of a hackathon called Hack Out West we built the Way Out West 2016
festival into minecraft.

We generated the landscape from maps, built the stage areas and
implemented so that the artists/bands spawned at the right stage when they
were going on stage. All great fun. Watch the video below to check it out
:)
